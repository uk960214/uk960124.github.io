      <description>Reference: For general structure - Youtube Channel Get __it Done!
For auto increment id on Google Sheets - Stack Overflow Question
Motivation For my react app, I wanted to create a page where I could ask for the user&amp;rsquo;s email and name, maybe for future marketing purposes. Although storing these kind of data would conventionally require a backend server and a database connected to it. However, I wanted this project to be as lightweight as possible, preferably a Front End only project.</description>

      <description>React - Create React App Creating a react app was&amp;hellip; harder than I expected, although Repl.it supported React template and even the Create React App template.
Concept of React With React, front end can be broken down into &amp;ldquo;Components&amp;rdquo;, which allows for further uses of the function later on.
Literally, it means that parts of html is written in pieces in javascript form, so that it can be written more efficiently with lots more extensibility.</description>

      <description>References:Youtube Tutorial by Telmo Sampaio Create-React-App Documentation
Although I thought the deployment part wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take that much time. But because of some minor mistakes I made in some stages, which was not explicitly explained by the create react app documentation, I had to start over a multiple times until I figured things out.
Basic Steps as explained by the documentation 1. Add homepage field to package.json The field could be placed in order in the package.</description>

      <description>Introduction I was asked to build a small app that takes in user input and create a downloadable image using those inputs. The user inputs their name and three colors (using html color picker) and the result image renders according to those inputs.
SVG After researching for different ways to manipulate images, I came across &amp;lsquo;svg&amp;rsquo;. Svg stands for &amp;lsquo;scalable vector images&amp;rsquo;, and put short, instead of saving image pixel by pixel as in other image files, svg saves &amp;lsquo;paths&amp;rsquo; of the image and &amp;lsquo;draw&amp;rsquo; this paths when called.</description>
