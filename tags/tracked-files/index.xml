      <description>Problem Since I was using Github in cooperation for the first time, there were a few problems I have encountered with pull and merges.
Before I pushed my working branch to Github, I should have checked whether an existing pull request exists, and if that were the case, the existing pull request should have be reviewed and merged first before I pushed my branch. This would have prevented me from facing merge conflicts after pushing to github.</description>
