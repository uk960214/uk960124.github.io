      <description>References:Youtube Tutorial by Telmo Sampaio Create-React-App Documentation
Although I thought the deployment part wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take that much time. But because of some minor mistakes I made in some stages, which was not explicitly explained by the create react app documentation, I had to start over a multiple times until I figured things out.
Basic Steps as explained by the documentation 1. Add homepage field to package.json The field could be placed in order in the package.</description>

      <description>Introduction I was asked to build a small app that takes in user input and create a downloadable image using those inputs. The user inputs their name and three colors (using html color picker) and the result image renders according to those inputs.
SVG After researching for different ways to manipulate images, I came across &amp;lsquo;svg&amp;rsquo;. Svg stands for &amp;lsquo;scalable vector images&amp;rsquo;, and put short, instead of saving image pixel by pixel as in other image files, svg saves &amp;lsquo;paths&amp;rsquo; of the image and &amp;lsquo;draw&amp;rsquo; this paths when called.</description>
